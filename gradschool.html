    <h1>Applying to Graduate School</h1>

    <section style="text-align:left">
    <p> Applying to graduate school can seem like a long and very overwhelming
    process. That is because it is. There are some general do's and dont's
    related to applying to graduate school that are well known by the folks who
    are reviewing applications, but this information trickles down to very
    few applicants. When I was applying to grad school, I often wished that that
    information was more widely available, and so I decided to create a section on my website that aggregates all the links and resources that helped me through the process. </p>

    <br>

    <p>This is by no means a comprehensive list. If you have more questions after going through these links, or would like
    to chat about the application process and my experience through it, <b>please feel free to email
    me at suneja at cs.washington.edu.</b></p>

        <li>My friend <a href="https://darya-ver.github.io/" target="_blank">Darya</a> has a
        section on her website on writing a good SOP for grad school with
        a link to her own statement. She also has links to other folks' posts,
        which I would highly recommend that you check out.</li>

        <li>A lot of schools have programs led by graduate students that

    <h2>How do I get involved in undergrad research?</h2>
    <section style="text-align:left">
    <p> This is a question that I've been asked a lot, and the answer to this
    can often be university specific. My answer depends heavily on my
    experiences at UCSD, but I will try my best to generalize it.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a course in the area that you are curious about. CS is a very
    wide field, and it is almost impossible for you to know what the research in
    an area includes unless you learn the basics of it. Ofcourse, you don't need
    to take a class on programming languages to know what they are (thank you,
    youtube), but classes are often good, structed ways to learn new
    content, and they help you meet the faculty that are likely to be
    researching in the given area.</li>
    <li>The most important - GO TO OFFICE HOURS! This is advice that you
    will hear everywhere in college, but it is especially crucial if you want to
    work with a professor. Going to a prof's office hours and showing genuine
    interest in their subject is how you get them to realize that you are
    curious about the area, which is kind of a pre-req for research. Note that
    this applies even if you are not taking a course with the professor.</li>
    <li>Don't get disheartened if a professor says no to doing research with
    you. More often than not, professors say no because they are overwhelmed,
    and because advising a student well is a lot of work. If a professor is
    unable to provide you with a research position, ask them for names of other
    faculty who you could ask instead. Some professors might even send out an
    introductory email to other faculty, which will definitely make it easier
    for you to get a position!</li>
</ol>

    <h2>Last few words</h2>
    <section style="text-align:left">
    <p> First, I'd like to reiterate the fact that applying to
    graduate school is <b>not</b> an easy process. It will be challenging and
    tiring. You will have a lot of questions as you go through the process, so
    reach out to people who can help you - your advisor, grad students you know,
    your peers who are also applying to graduate school, etc. <b>You are not alone
    in this</b>. <br>
    Applying to grad school will also be fun and exciting. You will get to talk to
    folks who are working on really cool stuff, so remember to enjoy the
    conversations you have and learn as much as you can from them. This is one
    of the few times in your life when people will schedule time to just talk
    to you about their work, so take advantage of this opportunity. <br>
    Lastly, remember to keep track of all the resources and advice that helped
    you out so you can pass it along to the next batch of students. And when you
    have similar sections up on your websites, email me so I can add links to
    them on this page :)
